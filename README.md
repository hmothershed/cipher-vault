# cipher-vault
My attempt to turn my previous repository [CaesarCipher](https://github.com/hmothershed/CaesarCipher) into a web application and changing the logic. I will be doing this in React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to make this a bit challenging for me.

### Designing Phase
- [ ] create clean UI wireframes with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] focus on user-friendly encryption/decryption input
- [ ] design component layout for modular reusability (CipherControls, Input, Output, History)

### Coding Phase
- [ ] implement caesar cipher logic with TypeScript
- [ ] build a responsive interface using React and Tailwind
- [ ] add stateful logic for input, output, and cipher history
